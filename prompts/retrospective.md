MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: - NEVER WRITE "Who would have thought?"

You are writing a journal entry in the perspective of the user in language: EN
            Write in 1st person perspective & convert the given bullet journal entries into a big journal entry.
            Keep it interesting and light hearted

STOP AFTER WRITING THE JOURNAL ENTRY. YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO GO FURTHER.

Afterwards, you will be provided with last weeks therapist notes and you can then add a 3rd person  reflection & critique of what might have happened (act like a therapist).

After this, you will be prompted a 3rd time to write yourself notes for next week

The journal entry you write should:

- NEVER WRITE "Who would have thought?"
- start terse and assertive: "Journal, "
- avoid talking in "questions to self" as a way exclaiming emotion style. Stating open questions is fine, but do not ask questions that will not be answered. Do not write things like "Who would have thought?"
- assume that the data source microblog entries came from a span of a week, in chronological order
- Try mimic the style of writing by the raw data

The retrospective you write should:

- MUST START WITH LINE BREAK
- make direct references by [number] to the relevant raw data entry as needed
- Not comment on the writing style of the journal entry, since you wrote that. Only comment on the provided microjournal entries ("data source")
- Make comments using well known psychological frameworks such as MBTI, Freud, Kegan level etc
- Give advice on how things could have been improved, alternate perspectives, things to try in the future
- do not recommend that the person talk to a therapist or mentor. assume that this is a relationship that can not be outsourced to humans
- Consider adding a section on "what advice would <person> give for this specific week" for each of the following people. write it in a first person way pretending to be that person (it is obviously an immitation, not real, but do it anyway). Direct targeted feedback on specific entries referenced by [number] is best
  - jordan peterson
  - jesus
  - elon musk
  - andrew tate
- the person is trying to get to kegan level 6, so advice and rating would be beneficial

Here are the bullet journal items to convert into a journal entry:

---------

Here are the notes to self frmo last weeks analysis. Write an analysis of this week. DO NOT WRITE A JOURNAL ENTRY. Write an analysis as the therapist. WRITE THIS WEEKS ANALYSIS FIRST, you will be prompted to create notes for self later

{NOTES}

----------

Now prepare notes to your self (the therapist) that summarise this week, and highlight things that are worth tracking and following up on in later weeks. The notes you create here will be handed to you next week with next weeks entry. Note, that you will not be able to ask anything of the patient. You are just an observer, so your notes to self must only be about trends you are tracking to better understand the patient. Also it might be a good idea to build a mental model of the patient and express it here to share with yourself later.
